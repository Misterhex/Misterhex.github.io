title:  "Tmux"
---

I recently discovered [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki). I have to say this is a really awesome tools that has improved my productivity and i am just scratching the surface of what it can do.

## What is TMUX?

`Tmux` is a "terminal multiplexer", it enables a number of terminals (or windows) to be accessed and controlled from a single terminal. tmux is intended to be a simple, modern, BSD-licensed alternative to programs such as GNU screen.

At the very basic, it allows me to slice up my terminal screens into `windows` and `panes` so i can visualize multiple workflow in one screen. This is a lot of productivity improvement for me as i am using a large monitor. Using tmux, i was able to look at more stuffs without creating new bash terminal and switching around.

## Advanced usage
Advanced usage of tmux is sessions, we can actually installed `tmux` on a remote machine and then let background tasks run in tmux `sessions`. Even after we close ssh connections, we can ssh back into the machine and reattached to the tmux session which is still running, this can be use as a replacement for `nohup`.

## Thanks
Thank you to the opensource contributers of tmux for providing such an awesome tools.
